overview of things that can go wrong in a project and how to handle things when
they do go wrong.

## Course Design Documents

The course design `./course_planning/course_design.md` contains the overall
course goals as well as per week outlines of the course content.

## Example Project Plan

The contents of `./example` are a sample example plan created for a
hypothetical birdhouse building project.

> This example plan is not perfect. You should think about this example as a
> step below a "minimum" quality for a project plan. Content written here
> should serve to inform the essence of what should go in each section.
