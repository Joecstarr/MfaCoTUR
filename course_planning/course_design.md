This document contains the course design for the ISA:4040 "Teaching Your
Undergraduate Research" course at The University of Iowa. The course is based on
the prior work of Hoffmann @hoffmannTeachingYourResearch2013 but adapted to the
undergraduate audience. The design for the course utilizes "Backward Design"
@wigginsUnderstandingDesign2008, "Ungrading" @stommelUndoingGrade, and "gradual
release of responsibility" @fisherBetterLearningStructured2013. The course has
been offered at The University of Iowa for approximately five years, this
repository contains materials for a redesign carried out in fall 2024.

# Overall Course Design

## Stage 1 - Desired Results

### Established Goals

Expectations that undergraduate students have engaged in research activities
before applying to graduate school are becoming more common. Notably lacking
from these expectations is the training of those undergraduate students'
instructional and communication skills. The development of these skills is
critical for producing a well-rounded undergraduate student who will be a
successful graduate student. The course's established goal is to provide
experience in instructional design and implementation to undergraduates whose
intention is to continue to graduate school.

Specifically this course is designed with the following goals:

1. Students can engage in teaching as a structured activity.
2. Students are confident to go rogue in their own learning.
3. Students acknowledge that failure breeds success.

### Transfer

_Students will be able to independently use their learning to…_

Students will leave this course with a knowledge of a collection of
instructional tools and how to effectively utilize them in the instructional
process.

### Meaning

#### Understandings

_Students will understand that…_

-   Course design takes time and effort.
-   Course design requires a thoughtful systematic approach.
-   Tools exist to enable effective course design.
-   Instruction requires engagement.


#### Essential Questions

-   How do you tailor a course for a chosen audience?
-   How do you design a course?
-   How do you create engaging instruction?
-   How do you evaluate student success?
-   How do you your evaluate success in instruction?

### Acquisition

#### Students will know…

-   How to use backwards design for ideation.
-   How to use backwards design for planning.
-   How to research instructional methods.
-   How to identify in effective instruction.
-   How to communicate complex ideas to a lay audience.
-   How to create engaging activities.
-   How to assess student understandings.
-   How to give, prompt, and receive peer feedback.

#### Students will be skilled at…

Students will be able to utilize instructional tools in practice.

## Stage 2 - Evidence and Assessment

### Evaluative Criteria

-   Students have a well-formed course design.
-   Students will present their lesson.
-   Students will evaluate thier .

### Assessment Evidence

#### Performance Task(s):
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The redesigned course has four deliverables for students combined into a
portfolio to be discussed in the final retrospective.

First, is a collection of the students' design documentation detailing the
evolution of their goals and the design of their lesson throughout the semester.
Students are presented with a backward design and encouraged to utilize it in
their design process. As they move through the course activities they are
invited to change their minds, go rogue, and retain the artifacts of their work.

Second, are the course materials used in their teaching unit. This generally
will include some of the following:

-   Slides
-   Activity materials
-   Demonstrations
-   Worksheets

Third is a collection of reflections on supplemental work or _mini-projects_.
The goal of this supplemental work is to give agency to the student in the
course. Students selects and reflects on 6 substantive tasks they complete over
the course of the semester. This includes but is not limited to; literature
reviews of teaching research, extensions of their teaching unit, or other
self-determined _mini-projects_ impacting their development in teaching.

The final item is a collection of peer observation prompts and responses written
and/or analyzed by the student. This includes a peer feedback of the student
elicits from the class following the teaching of their unit.

#### Other Evidence:

Students will have a touchpoint meeting through the semester. Touchpoint
meetings are required:

-   once per month
-   once the week before their presentation
-   once in the final week

During these meetings the goal is for the student to identify how and on what
that students will be evaluated, questions like the following should be
answered.

-   What quality are you aiming for?
-   What does an A,B,C,D look like?
-   How will you communicate progress?
-   How will you handle hurdles?

These should form the basis for specific evaluative criteria, beyond those found
in [](#CD_PT).

## Stage 3 - Learning Plan: _Summary of Key Learning Events and Instruction_

The course instruction content contains six to seven weeks of material.
Following this the remaining weeks are used for student presentations. The
instructional content follows a gradual release model
@fisherBetterLearningStructured2013. The first weeks are highly structured with
the instructor utilizing the majority of the time to model what the students
will be doing. As weeks progress the instructor should be managing less of the
classroom time, instead handing those responsibilities to the students.

The following is a high level overview of the course schedule:

1. Week 1 Getting started
    1. Syllabus
    2. Icebreaker
    3. Instructor gives a lightning talk.
2. Week 2 Model Lesson
    1. The instructor models a lesson on their research.
3. Week 3 Backward Design: Phase 1
    1. Overview of ideation with backward design
4. Week 4 Backward Design: Phase 2
    1. Overview of assessment strategies
    2. Discussion of engagement
5. Week 5 Student Lightning talks
6. Week 6 Draft exchange
7. Week 7-15: Student lessons
8. Week 15 Overview of qualitative analysis
    1. This can also be modified to fit in week 8 or assigned as reading.
9. Final Exam Retrospective meeting
