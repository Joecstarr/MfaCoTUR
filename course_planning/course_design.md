This document contains the course design for the ISA:4040 "Teaching Your
Undergraduate Research" course at The University of Iowa. The course is based on
the prior work of Hoffmann @hoffmannTeachingYourResearch2013 but adapted to the
undergraduate audience. The design for the course utilizes "Backward Design"
@wigginsUnderstandingDesign2008, "Ungrading" @stommelUndoingGrade, and "gradual
release of responsibility" @fisherBetterLearningStructured2013. The course has
been offered at The University of Iowa for approximately five years, this
repository contains materials for a redesign carried out in fall 2024.

# Overall Course Design

## Stage 1 - Desired Results

### Established Goals

Expectations that undergraduate students have engaged in research activities
before applying to graduate school are becoming more common. Notably lacking
from these expectations is the training of those undergraduate students'
instructional and communication skills. The development of these skills is
critical for producing a well-rounded undergraduate student who will be a
successful graduate student. The course's established goal is to provide
experience in instructional design and implementation to undergraduates whose
intention is to continue to graduate school.

Specifically this course is designed with the following goals:

1. Students can engage in teaching as a structured activity.
2. Students are confident to go rogue in their own learning.
3. Students acknowledge that failure breeds success.

### Transfer

_Students will be able to independently use their learning to…_

Students will leave this course with a knowledge of a collection of
instructional tools and how to effectively utilize them in the instructional
process.

### Meaning

#### Understandings

_Students will understand that…_

-   Course design takes time and effort.
-   Course design requires a thoughtful systematic approach.
-   Tools exist to enable effective course design.
-   Instruction requires engagement.
-   Assessment choice isn't arbitrary.
-   Assessment informs future instruction.
-   Formal analysis of feedback makes you better.

#### Essential Questions

-   How do you tailor a course for a chosen audience?
-   How do you design a course?
-   How do you create engaging instruction?
-   How do you evaluate student success?
-   How do you your evaluate success in instruction?

### Acquisition

#### Students will know…

-   How to use backwards design for ideation.
-   How to use backwards design for planning.
-   How to research instructional methods.
-   How to identify effective instruction.
-   How to communicate complex ideas to a lay audience.
-   How to create engaging activities.
-   How to assess student understandings.
-   How to give, prompt, and receive peer feedback.
-   How to analyze course reviews.

#### Students will be skilled at…

Students will be able to utilize instructional tools in practice.

## Stage 2 - Evidence and Assessment

### Evaluative Criteria

-   Students have a well-formed course design.
-   Students will present their lesson.
-   Students will evaluate their peer feedback.

### Assessment Evidence

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
(CD_PT)=
#### Performance Task(s):
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The redesigned course has four deliverables for students combined into a
portfolio to be discussed in the final retrospective.

1. A collection of the students' design documentation detailing the evolution of
   their goals and the design of their lesson throughout the semester. Students
   are presented with a backward design and encouraged to utilize it in their
   design process. As they move through the course activities they are invited
   to change their minds, go rogue, and retain the artifacts of their work.

2. The course materials used in their teaching unit. This generally will include
   some of the following:

    - Slides
    - Activity materials
    - Demonstrations
    - Worksheets

3. A collection of reflections on independent supplemental work or
   _mini-projects_. The goal of this supplemental work is to give agency to the
   student in the course. Students selects and reflects on 6 substantive tasks
   they complete over the course of the semester. This includes but is not
   limited to; literature reviews of teaching research, extensions of their
   teaching unit, or other self-determined _mini-projects_ impacting their
   development in teaching.

4. A collection of peer observation prompts and responses written and/or
   analyzed by the student. This includes a peer feedback of the student elicits
   from the class following the teaching of their unit.

#### Other Evidence:

Students will have touchpoint meetings with the instructor through the semester.

Touchpoint meetings are required:

-   once per month
-   once the week before their presentation
-   once in the final week

During these meetings the goal is for the student to identify how and on what
that student will be evaluated.

Questions like the following should be answered during meetings:

-   What quality are you aiming for?
-   What does an A,B,C,D look like?
-   How will you communicate progress?
-   How will you handle hurdles?

These should form the basis for specific evaluative criteria, beyond those found
in found in [](#CD_PT).

## Stage 3 - Learning Plan: _Summary of Key Learning Events and Instruction_

The course instruction content contains six to seven weeks of material.
Following this the remaining weeks are used for student presentations. The
instructional content follows a gradual release model
@fisherBetterLearningStructured2013. The first weeks are highly structured with
the instructor utilizing the majority of the time to model what the students
will be doing. As weeks progress the instructor should be managing less of the
classroom time, instead handing those responsibilities to the students.

The following is a high level overview of the course schedule specific details
for each week can be found in its section:

-   Week 1 Getting started found in [](#W1)
    1. Syllabus
    2. Icebreaker
    3. Instructor gives a lightning talk
-   Week 2 Model Lesson found in [](#W2)
    1. The instructor teaches a model lesson communicating the critical portions
       of their research.
-   Week 3 Backward Design: Phase 1 found in [](#W3)
    1. Overview of stage 1 of the backwards design process
    2. Discussion on finding scope
