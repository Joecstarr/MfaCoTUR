<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Students are asked to bring a draft of their lesson documents. They are also
asked to prepare criteria to lead conversation with peers. Instructor should be
present but should be largely disengaged. Students should be prompted to pair
off and that the instructor will make announcements at 10 minute intervals. On
the announcement students should shuffle their pairs.
