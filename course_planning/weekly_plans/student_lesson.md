# Week 7-14 Student Presentations
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
Each student will have an opportunity to "own" a week of instruction. The
instructor should behave as a normal member of the classroom.

During the touchpoint meeting the week before the student presents the student
will be instructed to construct a collection of prompts for their peers. These
should be built so that the student is getting feedback on exactly the areas
they are interested in. A thematic analysis of this feedback will be carried out
at the end of the semester. They should be reminded that the audience they are
building the unit for (lower division undergraduates usually) is not the same as
the audience they are presenting to (upper division). It's also good to remind
them that their audience is not homogenous (multiple backgrounds) and feedback
prompts should reflect that.
