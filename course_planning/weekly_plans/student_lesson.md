# Week 5 Design

Each student will have an opportunity to "own" a week of instruction. The
instructor should behave as a normal member of the classroom.

During touchpoint meeting the week before the student presents the student will
be instructed to construct a collection of prompts for their peers. These should
be built so that the student is getting feedback on exactly the areas they are
interested in. A thematic analysis of this feedback will be carried out at the
end of the semester. They should be reminded that the audience they are building
the unit for (lower division undergraduates usually) is not the same as the
audience they are presenting to (upper division). It's also good to remind them
that their audience is not homogenous (multiple backgrounds) and feedback
prompts should reflect that.
