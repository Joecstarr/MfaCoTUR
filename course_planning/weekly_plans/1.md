# Week 1 Getting Started
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Stage 1 - Desired Results

### Established Goals

Instruction is a difficult activity, one that undergraduate students rarely have
and opportunity to engage in. The remainder of the course requires that the
classroom be perceived as a team atmosphere. The goal this week is to build
confidence in students and develop comradery.

### Transfer

_Students will be able to independently use their learning to…_

Students will be able to formulate an outline for a lightning talk.

### Meaning

#### Understandings

_Students will understand that…_

Students will understand that they are part of a team and that the instructor is
there as support. Students will also understand what a lightning talk looks
like.

#### Essential Questions

-   How will we work together?
-   What is ungrading?
-   What is a lightning talk?

### Acquisition

#### Students will know…

-   The overview of the course.
-   How the grading will work in the course.
-   The format of a lightning talk.

#### Students will be skilled at…

Developing a lightning talk based on a model.

## Stage 2 - Evidence and Assessment

### Evaluative Criteria

Students will plan an initial touchpoint meeting. Students will produce slides
appropriate for a lightning talk.

### Assessment Evidence

#### Performance Task(s):

-   Students will schedule and attend a touchpoint meeting. (Week 2-5)
-   Students will submit draft slides for a lightning talk. (Week 4)
-   Students will present a lightning talk. (Week 5)
-   Students will complete 6 mini-projects. (Portfolio element)

#### Other Evidence:

None

## Stage 3 - Learning Plan: _Summary of Key Learning Events and Instruction_

1. Begin with an icebreaker.
2. Discuss syllabus and grading strategy.
    1. Ungrading reading [](#ungrading) should be assigned before class.
3. Explain what is a mini project
    1. Assign mini-project reading [](#miniprojects)
4. Explain what is a lightning talk
    1. Assign lightning talk reading [](#what_is_lightning)

(ungrading)=
### Ungrading
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The course will be "ungraded", this can be confusing if you have never seen or
heard of it before. I'll explain during the first session what I mean by
ungrading and how we'll work together to evaluate your performance in the
course.

Below you can find a selection of content to help further explain the concept of
ungrading (some of these might make good mini projects):

I'm happy to answer any questions you have just let me know.

(miniprojects)=
### What is a mini project?
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Most of our time in this class will be spent listening to others present their
teaching unit. To supplement this and make sure we hit our learning goals I’m
asking you to complete six of what I’m calling mini projects. A mini project
should take at most 2 hours outside of class (if you want to take more time
that's fine with me). A mini project can be any substantive project to further
your professional development in teaching. I will provide you some options (this
list may grow) but if none are interesting and/or you have an alternative
proposal please let me know.

#### Deliverables:

-   Project summary (think short abstract)
-   Description of what you did/read/built (1-2 paragraphs)
-   Reflection on how this impacted your professional development in teaching
    (1-2 paragraphs)

#### Project options:

-   Build a personal website.
-   Build materials to supplement your teaching (a model, an activity, ...).
-   Add a second session to your teaching unit.
-   An adaptation of your unit for a new audience.
-   Read teaching articles/books (if you can't find one of the listed
    articles/books let me know I will help find it) for books feel free to pick
    a chapter to review or talk to me about sections here's a bib file with
    citations

### What is a lightning talk?
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

A lightning talk is a 5 minute (3 slide) talk on a research topic. These short
talks are intended to communicate the essential elements of the research and to
spark further conversation. This is a common first experience in teaching
research we're going to run through everyone's lightning talk during this
course.
