# Week 3 Backward Design: Phase 1

## Stage 1 - Desired Results

### Established Goals

```{note}
The enduring understandings and learning goals of the lesson, unit, or course.
```

### Transfer

_Students will be able to independently use their learning to…_

```{note}
Refers to how students will transfer the knowledge gained from the lesson, unit, or course and apply it outside of the context of the course.
```

### Meaning

#### Understandings

_Students will understand that…_

```{note}
Refers to the big ideas and specific understandings students will have when the complete the lesson, unit, or course.
```

#### Essential Questions

```{note}
Refers to the provocative questions that foster inquiry, understanding, and transfer of learning. These questions typically frame the lesson, unit, or course and are often revisited. If students attain the established goals, they should be able to answer the essential question(s).
```

### Acquisition

#### Students will know…

```{note}
Refers to the key knowledge students will acquire from the lesson, unit, or course.
```

#### Students will be skilled at…

```{note}
Refers to the key skills students will acquire from the lesson, unit, or course.
```

## Stage 2 - Evidence and Assessment

### Evaluative Criteria

```{note}
Refers to the various types of criteria that students will be evaluated on.
```

### Assessment Evidence

#### Performance Task(s):

```{note}
Refers to the authentic performance task(s) that students will complete to demonstrate the desired understandings or demonstrate they have attained the goals. The performance task(s) are typically larger assessments that coalesce various concepts and understandings like large projects or papers.
```

#### Other Evidence:

```{note}
Refers to other types of evidence that will show if students have demonstrated achievement of the desired results. This includes quizzes, tests, homework, etc. This is also a good point to consider incorporating self-assessments and student reflections.
```

## Stage 3 - Learning Plan: _Summary of Key Learning Events and Instruction_

```{note}
This stage encompasses the individual learning activities and instructional strategies that will be employed. This includes lectures, discussions, problem-solving sessions, etc.
```

#### Things I think you should read:

-   I think skimming more of Understanding by design
    @wigginsUnderstandingDesign2008 will be helpful when filling out the
    backward design document.
