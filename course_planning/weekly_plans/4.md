# Week 4 Backward Design: Phase 2
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Stage 1 - Desired Results

### Established Goals

We saw last week that setting goals is the first step in backwards design. The
next step in the process is finding a way for us to understand if our goals have
been met. This is usually accomplished with some form of formative or summative
assessment. This week's goal is to introduce students to assessment and tools
for understanding when and how to select particular strategies.

### Transfer

_Students will be able to independently use their learning to…_

Students will be able to analyze assessment strategies for efficacy in various
usecases.

### Meaning

#### Understandings

_Students will understand that…_

-   Assessment choice isn't arbitrary.
-   Assessment informs future instruction.

#### Essential Questions

-   How do you evaluate student success?
-   How do you your evaluate success in instruction?

### Acquisition

#### Students will know…

-   How to assess student understandings.

#### Students will be skilled at…

Identifying and selecting appropriate assessment strategies for their lesson.

## Stage 2 - Evidence and Assessment

### Evaluative Criteria

Students are able to select and justify appropriate assessment strategies for
their lesson.

### Assessment Evidence

#### Performance Task(s):

Students select and justify assessment strategies for their lesson.

#### Other Evidence:

None.

## Stage 3 - Learning Plan: _Summary of Key Learning Events and Instruction_

Following the gradual release model we need to remove some support from our
students. To do this we will assign a collection of readings to the student and
let them choose their favorites to read. Additionally, in class it's good to
give fewer instructions compared to the specific assigned readings and specific
instructions from week 1.

Students will be assigned the reading assignment below as well as a collection
of engagement ideas for their lesson.

Discussion this week will follow a [jigsaw method](https://www.jigsaw.org)

1. Group students in to pairs, triplets, or quartets.
2. Have students discuss their readings.
3. Float around room asking if they need input or have questions.
4. Rotate group members after a time period (around 10 min).
5. Rinse and Repeat.

### Reading Assignment on Assessment

This week we'll be touching on assessment. If you TA or become a professor
you'll likely need to build quizzes and worksheets, so I think it's important to
see something on assessment. I'm hoping to give you some exposure and resources
so when that happens you, feel less lost and have something to build from. In
our teaching units for this class we'll be using engagement activities and
observation as an "assessment", I think some of these resources can help focus
activities for your unit. I don't expect intense critical reading on the long
articles/books/collections please pick a portion to read. I leave to you to find
what you feel is enough.

During class we'll start with groups discussing what they read. We'll then mix
groups and share what we read with each other.

### Reading assignment on Engagement

I'll periodically add content here for ideas to foster engagement in the
classroom these will range from activities to physical models:
