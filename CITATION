  Expectations for undergraduate students to have engaged in
  research activities before applying to graduate school are
  becoming more common. Notably lacking from these
  expectations is the training of those undergraduate
  students' instructional and communication skills. The
  development of these skills is critical for producing a
  well-rounded undergraduate student who will be a
  successful graduate student. Our institute, which is part
  of The University of Iowa offers a course for providing
  instructional development to undergraduate researchers.
  This repository contains the design documents for the
  course.
